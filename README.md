## Getting Started

To get started make sure [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download) installed locally and then run `npm install` within client and server directories.

Go to the server/dbscript directory and execute all the scripts by `node [filename]` to populate data into the db.

## Available Scripts

In client and server directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

When it will ask for userId, use '1234', '1235' or '1236' [These 3 users are created by the script]
