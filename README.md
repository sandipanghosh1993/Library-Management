## Library Management App

## Getting Started

To get started make sure [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download) installed locally and then run `npm install` within client and server directories.

Go to the server/dbscript directory and execute all the scripts using `node [filename]` to populate data into the db.

## Available Scripts

In client and server directories, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Client runs on http://localhost:3000 and server runs on http://localhost:8000<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />
When it will ask for userId, use '1234', '1235' or '1236' [These 3 users are created through db script]

### `npm test`
